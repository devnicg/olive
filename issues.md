## Issues: 
* implement git and commit logically
* add product dial is off center
* orders don't get registered
* add store settings to supabase for security purposes
* add role based access for admin page
* View order button does nothing on admin page
* add ability for users to track orders. 
* make store name (use it everywhere where you can), logo (svg format) and about and contact section editable for admins through the CMS system
* add different themes to the site settings page available for admins. 
* add i18n
* marking the product as favorite doesn't seem to work.
* add ability to add product showcase (dismissable) at top of the store page.
